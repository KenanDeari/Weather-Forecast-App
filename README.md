# Weather-Forecast-App

**Describtion

My motivation to complete this simple weather application was due to my interest in expanding my understanding of APIs. I implemented the OpenWeatherAPI to provide up to date weather information based on the city the user inputs. I ran into many issues understanding how to create content that can be outputted to my HTML file. I reviewed examples of other weather applications to get a starting point & idea of what needs to be done. 


**Instructions 
 
 To use this application, simply input the city you wish to see the weather in & press the magnifying glass logo to begin the search. You will then see a pop up with the next 5 day's estimated forecast. You can also press the "Get Current Location" to braodcast the weather based on the users location.
